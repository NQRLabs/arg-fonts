## History

The Zodiac Killer was a serial killer who operated in Northern California in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The killer sent a series of taunting letters and cryptograms to the press and police. Several of these ciphers remain unsolved to this day.

This font recreates the cipher symbols used in the Zodiac's most famous encrypted messages, including the 408-character cipher (solved in 1969) and the 340-character cipher (solved in 2020). The font allows ARG creators, puzzle designers, and cipher enthusiasts to easily create messages in the Zodiac cipher style.
