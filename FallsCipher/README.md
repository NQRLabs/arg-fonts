## Features

- **Complete alphabet mapping** - A-Z mapped to unique symbol glyphs
- **Thematic design** - Mysterious, occult-inspired symbol aesthetic
- **Web-optimized formats** - Available in TTF, OTF, and WOFF2
- **Part of a series** - First in the Falls Cipher collection

## History

This font is inspired by the symbol substitution ciphers found in the journals and mysteries of animated mystery media. The design captures the aesthetic of cryptographic symbols used in adventure stories involving supernatural mysteries, ancient secrets, and hidden knowledge.

The cipher system uses a combination of geometric shapes, modified letters, and alchemical-style symbols to create a visually distinctive cryptographic alphabet. While inspired by fictional ciphers, this font functions as a real substitution cipher suitable for puzzle creation, ARGs, and educational purposes.

**Note:** This font is an independent fan creation and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by any media franchise, production company, or network. It is created purely for educational, puzzle-making, and ARG design purposes.

## Naming Convention

This font is named "Falls Cipher" to evoke mystery themes while remaining distinct from any trademarked properties. Future fonts in this series may be numbered (FallsCipher-02, FallsCipher-03, etc.) to cover different cipher systems from similar thematic sources.
